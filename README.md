# Car race feature project

## Planning 

![](featureWireFrame.png)
The wireframe above illustrates the intended app design layout. Its  simple car race game of 3 cars, the user will only affect the speed of the top car, there will be three parameters in which the user can change in order to edit the performance speed of the car, the user will not know which parameters to select in order to have the fastest car. So everytime the user clicks race, 1 will be added to the counter, when the user wins a race they can reset the counter back to zero for the next player.

## Building 

I will use HTML CSS and JS to make this project, i will explore multiple ways to make the cars move across the screen before deciding on the final method.
I will use vanilla js. no frameworks or libraries.

## Debugging

I will debug my js using console.log() in various stages of my js code. This will then log my desired output to the js console within the google chrome dev tools feature. I will use the live server extension in vs code to render my project to the chrome browser in real time.
